# ChainPlot

Plot visualization for [FluxML/Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl)'s `Chain` neural networks.

It implements a plot recipe for `Flux.Chain` using the recipe tool from [JuliaPlots/RecipesBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/RecipesBase.jl).

This repository is for a prototype and testing bed for the recipe. There is currently no intention to mae it a registered Julia package. Instead, the aim is to PR it into [FluxML/Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl).

Nevertheless, one is welcome to install it directly via github, use it at your own will, and contribute to improve it.
